Retrain Phase 1 - Correct Method with Holdout Validation
===========================================================

Training Approach:
  - Full Walk-Forward + Filtered + Decoupled methodology
  - Feature reduction: LONG 85→80, SHORT 79 (Phase 1)
  - Holdout validation: Last 30 days reserved for testing
  - Exit threshold REMOVED from simulation (key fix!)

Key Fix:
  Original had NO threshold in simulation → Exit ANY candle
  Phase 1 Simulation had threshold 0.75 → Only exit when prob >= 0.75
  This version: Remove threshold, simulate ALL candles like Original
